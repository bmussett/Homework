#### Tableau workbook on public views of climate change; to accompany written story 

In David Beers's features class, I'm exploring how a couple of young climate-conscious women overcome the anxiety and dread that naturally arise when engaging with the reality climate change. To give the reader an idea of how the public generally thinks about climate change, I'd like to create multiple visualizations based on recent public opinion data on the topic. I'm specifically interested in data that indicates the level concern people have about climate change.

I've tracked down these recent data sources to pull from, but I'm going to keep searching for more interesting results: 

1) 'Is Climate change "an emergency" and do Canadians support a Made-in-Canada Green New Deal?'' (Aug. 12, 2019, Abacus Data) - https://abacusdata.ca/is-climate-change-an-emergency-and-do-canadians-support-a-made-in-canada-green-new-deal/

2) 'Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation Climate Change Survey, July 9-Aug. 5, 2019' - https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/washington-post-kaiser-family-foundation-climate-change-survey-july-9-aug-5-2019/601ed8ff-a7c6-4839-b57e-3f5eaa8ed09f/

#### Notes: 

- I'd prefer to use survey data involving Canadians, but the WaPo data is interesting as it separates the respondents based on age group (teens or adults). 

- Another potential issue: Some of the survey results have already been processed into graphs and charts. Is this a problem? The graphics that have been created are fairly basic. I'd like to create more interesting, unconventional visualizations to draw the reader in, if possible. 

- My feature story will have me travel to Tahsis, British Columbia, a small community on the north-west coast of Vancouver Island where one of the story's subjects lives. This may be extremely ambitious, but I've also considered creating a Polymap of the surrounding region that would show the future effects of climate change in the area.
